* A discretized population balance for nucleation, growth, and aggregation
** Population balance
The population balance for a well-mixed batch system of constant volume is given as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial(Gn)}{\partial L}=B-D
\end{equation}
$n$ is the number-density function: If there are $dN$ particles per unit volume of suspension in the size range $L$ to $dL$, then at that size and time the density function if $n=dN/dL$. 
*** Aggregation
Birth rate by aggregation
\begin{align}
B'(v)&=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^v\beta'(v-\epsilon,\epsilon)n'(v-\epsilon)n'(\epsilon)d\epsilon\\
D'(v)&=n'(v)\int_0^\infty\beta'(v,\epsilon)n'(\epsilon)d\epsilon
\end{align}
The prime is used to signify volume as the internal coordinate. The coalescence kernel, $\beta'(v,\epsilon)$, is a measure of the frequency of collisions between particles of volume $v$ and $\epsilon$.
